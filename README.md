#  Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort 3

This project demonstrates how to build and configure a basic Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using **Snort 3** on a Linux environment (Ubuntu). It includes custom rule writing, attack simulation, and alert monitoring using tools like `ping`, `nmap`, `hydra`, `curl`, and `hping3`.

---

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to detect and log suspicious network activities using Snort 3. It covers:
- Installing and configuring Snort 3
- Writing and testing custom Snort rules
- Simulating network attacks (e.g., ICMP ping flood, SSH brute-force)
- Monitoring and analyzing alerts generated by Snort

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Snort 3**
- **Ubuntu Linux**
- **Hydra** – for brute force attacks
- **Nmap** – for port scans and XMAS scans
- **Hping3** – for TCP/ICMP packet crafting
- **Curl / Dig** – for HTTP and DNS testing

## Setup Instructions
1.Install Snort 3
Follow the official guide: https://docs.snort.org/snort3#installation

2.Configure Snort

Edit the snort.lua configuration file

Set HOME_NET and interface details

3. Add your custom rule file under snort_defaults.lua

4. Run Snort

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.lua -i eth0 -A alert_fast -l /var/log/snort

5.Simulate Attacks
Use provided attack commands (in report) to trigger rules.

6. Check Logs

View alerts in /var/log/snort/alert.fast

Use tcpdump or Wireshark for deeper packet inspection

 7.Sample Custom Rule
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 22 (msg:"[SSH] Possible brute force login attempt"; flags:S; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
This rule detects SSH login attempts using only SYN flags (often indicating brute-force behavior).
